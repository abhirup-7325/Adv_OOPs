 * Each customer of a bank has customer id, name, and current loan amount and phone number. One
can change the attributes like name, phone number. A customer may ask for loan of certain amount.

It is granted provided the sum of current loan amount and asked amount does not exceed credit limit
(fixed amount for all customer). A customer can be a privileged customer. For such customers credit
limit is higher. Once a loan is sanctioned necessary updates should be made. Any type of customer
should be able to find his credit limit, current loan amount and amount of loan (s)he can seek. No
customer can change customer id once created. Print customer name when the object is printed by
toString() method.
Design and implement the classes. Show the working through a menu driven user interface.
