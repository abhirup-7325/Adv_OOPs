/*
 * A Planet Explorer routinely travels across the planets in the Solar System to discover life form,
minerals available, etc. However, the method of exploring is different on each planet, due to the
difference in atmosphere and surface composition. Every explorer should have an explore method
that is defined based on the type of the explorer and the planet where (s)he is exploring. Consider
three planets-Mars, Venus, and Saturn.
Implement it using interfaces, abstract class, inheritance.
